Bluetooth: Peripheral UART 
##########################

.. contents::
   :local:
   :depth: 2

The Peripheral UART sample demonstrates how to use the :ref:`nus_service_readme`.
It uses the NUS service to send data back and forth between a UART connection and a BluetoothÂ® LE connection, emulating a serial port over Bluetooth LE.
There is added code that will Suspend the UART and place the device into IDLE or SYSTEM OFF states

Requirements
************

The sample supports the following development kits:

.. table-from-sample-yaml::

.. include:: /includes/tfm.txt

.. note::

The sample also requires using a compatible application for `Testing`_.
You can use the `Bluetooth Low Energy app`_ for desktop or the `nRF Connect for Mobile`_ (or other similar applications, such as `nRF Blinky`_ or `nRF Toolbox`_).
Using mobile applications for testing requires a smartphone or tablet.

You can also test the application with the :ref:`central_uart` sample.
See the documentation for that sample for detailed instructions.

.. note::
   |thingy53_sample_note|

   The sample also enables an additional :ref:`USB CDC ACM class serial port <thingy53_app_usb>` that is used instead of UART 0.
   Because of that, it uses a separate USB Vendor and Product ID.

Overview
********

When connected, the sample forwards any data received on the RX pin of the UART 0 peripheral to the Bluetooth LE unit.
On Nordic Semiconductor's development kits, the UART 0 peripheral is typically gated through the SEGGER chip to a USB CDC virtual serial port.

Any data sent from the Bluetooth LE unit is sent out of the UART 0 peripheral's TX pin.

After 5 seconds of advertising, if the device does not connect, it will suspend the UART to save _Power
After another 5 Seconds it will disable advertising and enter System IDLE state.
If button 1 is pressed, the device will enter System OFF
The device can be woken from system OFF by pressing button 2


.. note::
   Thingy:53 uses the second instance of USB CDC ACM class instead of UART 0, because it has no built-in SEGGER chip that could be used to gate UART 0.

.. _peripheral_uart_debug:

Debugging
=========

In this sample, the UART console is used to send and read data over the NUS service.
Debug messages are not displayed in this UART console.
Instead, they are printed by the RTT logger.

If you want to view the debug messages, follow the procedure in :ref:`testing_rtt_connect`.

.. note::
   On the Thingy:53, debug logs are provided over the :ref:`USB CDC ACM class serial port <thingy53_app_usb>` instead of :ref:`RTT or other logging backends <ug_logging_backends>`.

For more information about debugging in the |NCS|, see :ref:`debugging`.

FEM support
***********

.. include:: /includes/sample_fem_support.txt

.. _peripheral_uart_minimal_ext:


USB CDC ACM extension
=====================

For the boards with the USB device peripheral, you can build the sample with support for the USB CDC ACM class serial port instead of the physical UART.
This build uses the sample-specific UART async adapter module that acts as a bridge between USB CDC ACM and Zephyr's UART asynchronous API used by the sample.
See :ref:`peripheral_uart_sample_activating_variants` for details about how to build the sample with this extension using the :file:`prj_cdc.conf` file.

Async adapter experimental module
---------------------------------

The default sample configuration uses the UART async API.
The sample uses the :ref:`lib_uart_async_adapter` library to communicate with the USB CDC ACM driver.
This is needed because the USB CDC ACM implementation provides only the interrupt interface.

To use the library, set the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_UART_ASYNC_ADAPTER` Kconfig option to ``y``.

User interface
**************

The user interface of the sample depends on the hardware platform you are using.

.. tabs::

   .. group-tab:: nRF53 DKs

       Button 1:
         Place the device in SYSTEM OFF by calling sys_poweroff().
        
      Button 2:
         Wake from System OFF

   .. group-tab:: Thingy:53

      Button:
         Thingy:53 has only one button, Pressing button will place device in System OFF
         There is no wake from SYSTEM OFF power levels for the THINGY:53

Configuration
*************

|config|

Configuration options
=====================

Check and configure the following configuration options for the sample:

.. _CONFIG_UART_ASYNC_ADAPTER:

CONFIG_UART_ASYNC_ADAPTER - Enable UART async adapter
   Enables asynchronous adapter for UART drives that supports only IRQ interface.

Testing
=======

After programming the sample to your development kit, complete the following steps to test the basic functionality:

.. tabs::

   .. group-tab:: nRF53 DKs

      1. Connect the device to the computer to access UART 0.
         If you use a development kit, UART 0 is forwarded as a COM port (Windows) or ttyACM device (Linux) after you connect the development kit over USB.
         If you use Thingy:53, you must attach the debug board and connect an external USB to UART converter to it.
      #. |connect_terminal|
      #. Reset the kit.
      #. Observe that **LED 1** is blinking and the device is advertising under the default name **Nordic_UART_Service**.
         You can configure this name using the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_DEVICE_NAME` Kconfig option.
      #. Observe that the text "Starting Nordic UART service sample" is printed on the COM listener running on the computer.

.. _peripheral_uart_testing_mobile:

Testing with nRF Connect for Mobile
-----------------------------------

You can test the sample pairing with a mobile device.
For this purpose, use `nRF Connect for Mobile`_ (or other similar applications, such as `nRF Blinky`_ or `nRF Toolbox`_).

To perform the test, complete the following steps:

               You can write to the UART RX and get the text displayed on the COM listener.
            #. Type "0123456789" and tap :guilabel:`SEND`.

               Verify that the text "0123456789" is displayed on the COM listener.

.. _peripheral_uart_testing_ble:

Testing with Bluetooth Low Energy app
-------------------------------------

If you have an nRF52 Series DK with the Peripheral UART sample and either a dongle or second Nordic Semiconductor development kit that supports the `Bluetooth Low Energy app`_, you can test the sample on your computer.
Use the `Bluetooth Low Energy app`_ in `nRF Connect for Desktop`_ for testing.

To perform the test, complete the following steps:

1. Install the `Bluetooth Low Energy app`_ in `nRF Connect for Desktop`_.
#. Connect to your nRF52 Series DK.
#. Connect the dongle or second development kit to a USB port of your computer.
#. Open the app.
#. Select the serial port that corresponds to the dongle or the second development kit.
   Do not select the kit you want to test just yet.

   .. note::
      If the dongle or the second development kit has not been used with the Bluetooth Low Energy app before, you may be asked to update the J-Link firmware and connectivity firmware on the nRF SoC to continue.
      When the nRF SoC has been updated with the correct firmware, the app finishes connecting to your device over USB.
      When the connection is established, the device appears in the main view.

#. Click :guilabel:`Start scan`.
#. Find the development kit you want to test and click the corresponding :guilabel:`Connect` button.

   The default name for the Peripheral UART sample is *Nordic_UART_Service*.

#. Select the **Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter (UART)** RX characteristic value.
#. Write ``30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39`` (the hexadecimal value for the string "0123456789") and click :guilabel:`Write`.

   The data is transmitted over Bluetooth LE from the app to the DK that runs the Peripheral UART sample.
   The terminal emulator connected to the development kit then displays ``"0123456789"``.

#. In the terminal emulator, enter any text, for example ``Hello``.

   The data is transmitted to the development kit that runs the Peripheral UART sample.
   The **UART TX** characteristic displayed in the app changes to the corresponding ASCII value.
   For example, the value for ``Hello`` is ``48 65 6C 6C 6F``.
